First of all, I want to apologize for my terrible english. I'm trying to improve that during the pandemic. 

This is my first repository and my first uploaded file is a project for my professor. It obviously still need a lot of repairs and
the most important: needs to be fineshed. So, due to a lot of thins that happened last week, I brought here what I wrote with 
an incredible amount of persistence and tears. I've spent a long time without programming before this and my skills are not the best 
(I'm working to improve that too), so I can guarantee that I gave my best and that my best made me a little bit ashemed, but aren't 
we all here to learn? Hope I can think that this project was like the easiest ones as soon as possible.

This project is supposed to be a memory heap simulator. 

Any help is welcome.

Thanks for reading me.
